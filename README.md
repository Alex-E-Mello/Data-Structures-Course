# Mountain State Software Solutions Coding Challenge
The purpose of this repository is to upload my code for the Mountain State Software Solutions coding challenge.

This coding challenge is for an interview for the Jr. Software Engineer position.



## Tech
The project uses two open source projects to work properly:

* [Java 15]
* [SQLiteJDBC]



## Installation
The source code is uploaded to this repository as an Eclipse Java project. Even though it is an Eclipse Java project it can easily be loaded into any Java IDE using the same instructions.

Download the source code as a ZIP file, extract the folder from the ZIP file, and then import the extracted folder into your IDE as an existing Java project.



## Usage
To run the project through your Java IDE you have to run Main.java.

The console will prompt you to enter the filename of the file you want to use. There is a default file in the folder that can be used by entering:
```sh
ms3Interview.csv
```

To run the program using a different file, place the file in the same folder where ms3Interview.csv is and enter your filename when prompted.
